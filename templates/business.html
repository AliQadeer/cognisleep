					<h2>Sleeping Pills</h2>
					<p>According to Time.com, roughly 9 million Americans, or 4% of US adults, use prescription sleep aids or medications to help with sleep disorders. The FDA has issued warnings pertaining to three widely used sedative-hypnotic sleep aids, connecting them to accidental overdoses, falls, and near drownings. This can be a huge liability for employers who have employees who are hooked on sleeping pills.<sup>[2]</sup></p>

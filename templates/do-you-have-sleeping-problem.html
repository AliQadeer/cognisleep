                                    is sometimes known, is dummy text used in laying out print, graphic or web designs.
                                    The passage is attributed to an unknown typesetter in the 15th century who is
                                    thought to have scrambled parts of Cicero’s&nbsp;<em>De Finibus Bonorum et
                                        Malorum</em>&nbsp;for use in a type specimen book. It usually begins with:</p>
                                <blockquote class="page-section__blockquote"><p>“Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur
                                    adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna
                                    aliqua.”</p></blockquote>
                                <p class="f4 cl-white mv16">The purpose of&nbsp;<em>lorem ipsum</em>&nbsp;is to create a
                                    natural looking block of text (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) that doesn’t
                                    distract from the layout. A practice not without&nbsp;controversy, laying out pages
                                    with meaningless filler text can be very useful when the focus is meant to be on
                                    design, not content.</p>
                                <p class="f4 cl-white mv16">The passage experienced a surge in popularity during the
                                    1960s when Letraset used it on their dry-transfer sheets, and again during the 90s
                                    as desktop publishers bundled the text with their software. Today it’s seen all
                                    around the web; on templates, websites, and stock designs. Use our&nbsp;generator&nbsp;to
